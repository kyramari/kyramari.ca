        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Challenge</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">While doing my internship at McMillan, they had a small client come to them requesting a brand. The project was given to the other intern and I. We each had to create a brand concept for the client, and she would choose which one to use at the end.</p>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">Her business is called Makhaya Design. It is an interior design store/ small coffee shop. She also teaches interior design lessons. Some of the words she used to describe what she wanted where: clean and clear line, Bauhaus style, post-modern, industrial style.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Process</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">Based on her brief, I started looking on Pinterest for any inspiration, made a couple moodboards, did a ton of sketches, and ended up with two final concepts. I worked with an art director to improve my concepts and to get them ready to show the client. The concepts were presented and she ended up picking one of mine. The more minimalistic, industrial style one.</p>

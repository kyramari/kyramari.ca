        <h3 class="zetta push island-1-2">App Concept & Design</h3>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Role</h4>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="gutter-1-2">App Concept</li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">Graphic Design</li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">UX/UI</li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">Prototype</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Challenge</h4>
        <p class="island-1-2">Create an App that makes it easy for the user to change the temperature of their house from any location so they can save money on heating. </p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Solution</h4>
        <p class="gutter-1-2">I came up with a concept that allows the user to adjust the temperature from any location and tracks their spending so that they can save money. </p>
        <p class="gutter-1-2">I named this app ThermoSet. It is simple, clear, and descriptive.</p>
        <p class="gutter-1-2">Using ThermoSet you can change the temperature of your home in one click. And you can do it from any location.</p>
        <p class="gutter-1-2">ThermoSet allows you to easily preset the temperature, set a personal limit for each month, and track your spending so that you can minimize your monthly costs.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Process</h4>
        <p class="gutter-1-2">The target audience is middle-aged people with a good income. The visual design of this App is very clean with a lot of white space; Professional and easy to understand. This is so it can be used quickly, as the people using it don't have a lot of time. </p>
        <p class="gutter-1-2"><strong>I imagined the kinds of people that would use this app. I created two different personas:</strong></p>
        <ol class="list-group">
          <li class="gutter-1-2 push">1. Sarah is 37, has three kids and a husband. She is so busy with all of her kids all over the place that she is just in and out of the house constantly. She is too busy to think about the temperature of the house. So Sarah waists money on heating or cooling when she isn’t even in the house. </li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">2. Dan Smith is a man in his late 40’s. He is divorced and his kids have grown up and moved out. He travels for his job a lot. Dan is always so busy with work and trying to catch his flights so he is always leaving the heating or cooling on by accident. He needs a reminder to turn it off when he leaves his house and a way to do that from any location.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="gutter-1-2">Using this information I was able to put together a list of things that the app needs to do. I used this to start sketching a design concept.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push island-1-2">Sketches</h4>
        <img class="img-flex push"src="../images/placeholder-16by9.svg" alt="">

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Design</h4>
        <p class="gutter-1-2">The design interface is very simple. ThermoSet was designed for use on an Android phone. To ensure that the user experience was effective, I used Material Design as a basis for my design.</p>

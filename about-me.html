          <p>My name is kyra Rogers. I am an Ottawa-based graphic Designer. Graphic design is literally everywhere you look. It's such a unique way to convey messages that impact people in ways they might not even realize. Being able to fill the world with colour, and somehow make a living off of it, is amazing.</p>

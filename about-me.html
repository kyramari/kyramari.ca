    <h3 class="zetta push-0 island-1-2">Hi,</h3>

    <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">My name is Kyra. I'm an Ottawa-based Graphic Designer. I specialize in branding, logo design, and web design. I've also had lots of experience with digital ads and social media. I think it's really important to fully understand what you (the client) want. So that I can elevate and build off your ideas and bring them to life.</p>

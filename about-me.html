    <h3 class="zetta push-0 island-1-2">Hi,</h3>

    <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">I am an Ottawa-based Graphic Designer. I specialize in  branding, UX/UI, and motion graphics, but love all of it.</p>

    <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">Graphic design is literally everywhere you look. It's such a unique way to convey messages that impact people in ways they might not even realize. Being able to fill the world with colour, pattern and imagery and somehow make a living off of it, is my inspiration.</p>
    <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">I’ve loved art and craft from a very young age. I’ve enjoyed painting, pottery, drawing, sculpture, doodling and digital design – anything really that involves visual art and working with my hands!  I love traditional art just as much as digital and like to use both in my marketing and communications work.</p>

    <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Status</h4>
    <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">I am currently available for employment opportunities.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Role</h4>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="gutter-1-2">App Concept</li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">UX/UI</li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">Prototype</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Challenge</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="island-1-2">Communication between Ottawa residents and the municipal government is weak. Our client wanted some sort of platform (application, website, etc) that would help both the residents and the municipal government get feedback faster. This would help improve the city in the long run as well as increase transparency between the government and the people.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Solution</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">As a group, we designed and created a prototype for an application to help improve government to citizen communication. It will help these people connect with the government, express their thoughts on how the area is being treated, and give them closure when the problem is finally solved. With this app, the citizens themselves will be able to make a difference in their community. This will help them finally have a say in the state of the neighbourhood.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Process</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">Our target audience for this project was smaller communities, new and old, populated with families and people who are very involved in bettering their neighbourhoods. Since there are so many smaller towns in the Ottawa region, we decided to focus on one area. People living in these areas love their town and would love to help their areas thrive. They are vibrant, intelligent, thoughtful and are always thinking of ways to help bring their communities together. They donâ€™t like it when they see that their neighbourhood is dirty, poorly taken care of and wasting away. </p>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">The client showed us a similar application that they use in Brazil. The design and flow of the app are rough, but we thought we would base out new app off of it.</p>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">One of the functions that our client wanted to have included, was to be able to take a photo of a pothole, for example, and post it. The amount of "likes" the post had, compared to other posts would help the government prioritize which issue got fixed first. When the issue is fixed, it shows it in the app, and you get a notification. Because of the photo aspect of the application, we also based our design on Instagram. Doing this would also make it easier for the user to learn, as most will already be used to the general layout.</p>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2"><strong>Using this all this information we were able to put together a couple basic app flows:</strong></p>
        <ol class="list-group">
          <li class="gutter-1-2 push">1. Post a picture</li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">2. Search for issues near you</li>
          <li class="gutter-1-2">3. View a profile (less important, but necessary to keep track of which issues have been fixed and which haven't)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Design</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">This is an app that allows the user to post any issues that they see in their neighbourhood and around the city, Because of this, they will most likely be annoyed or mad going into the application. Because of this, the design needs to be friendly. To do this, we used a cheerful colour palette and an overall friendly feel. This will encourage the user's sense of accomplishment and handle any sense of hostility that they may have felt going into the experience.</p>

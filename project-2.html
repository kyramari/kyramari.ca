        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Challenge</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">For this project, I had to rebrand a small bookstore. The Inspirational Value Center is a religious store. They sell books, movies, audio tapes, colouring books, and trinkets for your home. They are all about peace and happiness. My task was to create a whole new brand that really depicts the cheerful atmosphere of the store, as well as the religious aspect of it.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Process</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">The process I went threw for this rebrand, was sketches, sketches, and more sketches. I started by sketching 30 of any and every idea that popped into mind. I then narrowed it down to two. I sketched 20 versions of these two ideas and 10 more new ones. This process was really important to get every single idea down on paper. The final idea I chose was so far from where I started, and I could not have gotten there without going through this crazy process.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Two Different Concepts</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">After I narrowed down my sketched ideas to two solid concepts. I created both of them in Illustrator. I made logo boards for each, with different scales of the logo, black n' white and reversed versions, and the colours. I presented these to the client and let them decide.</p>

        <h4 class="peta push-0 island-1-2">Final Design</h4>
        <p itemprop="description" class="gutter-1-2">Doves represent peace and are a widely known symbol of Christianity. The negative space in this circle shows a dove. The colours I chose are bright and playful. I picked these three colours so that they would work well interchangeably but to also look good together. My idea was that any materials designed would be designed for each colour. Business cards, for example, would be printed in all three colours and handed out at random. This colourfull aspect of the brand really shows how fun and happy the bookstore is.</p>
